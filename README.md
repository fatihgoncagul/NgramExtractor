# NgramExtractor
This is an assignment which was given at Data Structures Class.The subject of this assignment is Hashmap.
### Assignment: 
You are expected to develop a N-gram analyzer tool. Given a text document and a n value, you must
extract all n-gram features of the text document. N-gram is a contiguous sequence of n words from a
given sample of text or speech. Your program must be compiled properly and produces output as desired
when below commands executed:
> $javac NgramExtractor.java

> $java NgramExtractor input.txt output.csv n

A `n` value can be any positive integer. The output file must be CSV (comma-separated values) formatted
file.
You must use HashMap data structure to hold n-gram features and their count value. You must exclusively compute frequency for each n-gram features. The output must be sorted by count value descendingly.
You can examine http://guidetodatamining.com/ngramAnalyzer/ website to understand the homework better and check your program whether produces correct output
